📊 Real-Time Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Project
This project focuses on real-time data handling and preprocessing tasks using Python and Excel. The objective is to clean raw datasets by identifying and fixing common data quality issues to prepare them for further analysis or modeling.

🚀 Project Goals
Understand and apply standard data preprocessing techniques.

Clean and structure multiple real-world datasets from Kaggle.

Practice using tools like Pandas in Python and Excel for data wrangling.

📂 Tasks Performed
The following preprocessing steps were performed consistently across datasets:

Missing Values Handling

Identified using .isnull() in Python or filters in Excel.

Handled with appropriate imputation or removal techniques.

Duplicate Removal

Removed duplicate rows using .drop_duplicates() in Python or Excel’s "Remove Duplicates" function.

Text Standardization

Normalized categorical variables like gender, country names, etc.

Date Formatting

Unified all date formats into dd-mm-yyyy for consistency.

Column Renaming

Cleaned and renamed headers to be lowercase and space-free for uniformity.

Data Type Fixes

Ensured proper data types for each column (e.g., int for age, datetime for dates).

📁 Datasets Used
The following datasets from Kaggle were used for hands-on cleaning practice:

Customer Personality Analysis

Medical Appointment No Shows

Mall Customer Segmentation Data

Netflix Movies and TV Shows

Sales Data

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Jupyter Notebook
